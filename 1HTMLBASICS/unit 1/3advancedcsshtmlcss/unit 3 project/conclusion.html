    <h1> Who Is Greater</h1>
    <p> Getting down to the last parts of the debate. </p>
    <h1> Gretzky</h1>
   <p> Gretzky had a amazing career, he dominated all of his seasons. He finished his career with 1487 games played, 894 goals, 1963 assists, and a whopping final 2857 points and a +520 in plus minus. </p>

<p> To end it off, Wayne Gretszky is the better player in this debate. Even though OVI is a great player, wayne has the better stats, accolades, and is more of a skill player. If most people were asked, they would most defintly want gretszky on a team other than ovi. Ovi is a great player who can do it all, but gretszky is one of a kind with multiple 200 point seasons which most players now get around 80-140 in 82 games.  </p>
