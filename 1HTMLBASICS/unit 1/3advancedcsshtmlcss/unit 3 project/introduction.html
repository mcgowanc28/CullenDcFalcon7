    <h1> Who Is Better</h1>
    <h2> Ovechkin Or Gretzky</h2>
    <p> Wayne Gretsky, the all around "great one" is considerd the best player of all time. He dominated his years of the sport and has many records that will never be beaten ever. He holds the record for most points of all time, most assists, most points in a season, and the list goes on. He played 20 seasons in the NHL and averged nearly 2 points a game! Wayne also won four stanley cups and winning the playoff MVP twice. The list of this guys acomplishments could go on forever. But when talking about his greatness the argument comes up. The main argument is how poor his compition he played agaisnt was in comparision to today. Don't get me wrong, Gretzky played against Mario Lemieux (whom Gretzky himself acknowledged was a better scorer), Bobby Orr, Billy Smith, and Dave Semenko. Gretzky also faced some formidable goalies like Dominik Hasek, Martin Brodeur, and Chris Osgood. But other than that, it was not that great.

    <h2> Ovechkin</h2>
    <p> Alex Ovechkin, the great eight! Who recently just passed Wayne for the most goals of all time in less amount of games. Proving he is the superior goal scorer. Best goal scorer of all time. This guy is a straight beast. Waynes game was more skilled as Ovechkins game is a hard working forward who can do it all. All of his records broke have to do with goals. Most goals of all time, most goals with one team, most goals on a powerplay, and most empty net goals. Ovechkin has one stanley cup and  has won the Hart Memorial Trophy three times, the Conn Smythe Trophy once, and the Calder Memorial Trophy once. The only argument here is how the equipment has evolved so much. In gretzkys time there was wood sticks, goalies had horrible equipment making them worse, and there were no helmts for some of his career. Ovechkin on the other hand, has all the equipment up to date with the better sticks, skates, gloves, etc.</p>  <a href="graph.html"> Data Presentation</a>
