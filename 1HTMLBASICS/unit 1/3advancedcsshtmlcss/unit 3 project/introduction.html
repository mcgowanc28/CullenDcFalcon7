    <h1> Who Is Better</h1>
    <h2> Ovechkin Or Gretzky</h2>
    <p> Wayne Gretsky, the all around "great one" is considerd the best player of all time. He dominated his years of the sport and has many records that will never be beaten ever. He holds the record for most points of all time, most assists, most points in a season, and the list goes on. He played 20 seasons in the NHL and averged nearly 2 points a game! Wayne also won four stanley cups and winning the playoff MVP twice. The list of this guys acomplishments could go on forever. But when talking about his greatness the argument comes up. The main argument is how poor his compition he played agaisnt was in comparision to today. Don't get me wrong, Gretzky played against Mario Lemieux (whom Gretzky himself acknowledged was a better scorer), Bobby Orr, Billy Smith, and Dave Semenko. Gretzky also faced some formidable goalies like Dominik Hasek, Martin Brodeur, and Chris Osgood. But other than that, it was not that great. </p>
