        <p> To start it off, dogs are one of the most loyal animals on the planet. I know we all know the saying, "a dog is a mans bestfriend". Good thing for us, that is so true! Besides being very loyal, dogs are very protective of there owners, they are your little ride or dies. Now obviously if you have a huge cane corso, he will protect you a little better than a shih tzu. But all dogs will be there for you right at your side. To continute on the personality of there beautiful souls, they can be very intelligent. If you train your dog to do certain things, they can be your little Albert Einstein buddy. Some people think the smartest thing they can do is climb ladders, or chase a ball. But hands down the smartest thing is to understand our language and gestures. To be real, they learn a new language in there 14 years of living and can go fetch you a pop if you want.  </p>

            <h1> The History Of The Dog</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> The History of the <strong> dog</strong> can get pretty crazy. It started out as a little weasel back around 40 million years ago. From there it became a wolf, then a fox. From a fox, it kinda gets a little bit wonky. It got evolved to many different things and after a lot of evolving it became the worlds first <i> dog</i> After all the breeding with other dogs, people noticed these cute little guys, or girls. And right away knew they needed them because of there loyalty. Dogs then became loyal war dogs whom faught in war. From there people mixed breeds and created cuter dogs and exotic dogs, which look cute to the eye, but can really mess a dog up. </p>

        <h1> Best Dog Breeds To Purchase</h1> 
        <hr>
        <p> Now that you know all of the basics and history of our cute little or big friends, here are the best breeds to purchase. The type of dogs people want can differ. If you want a dog who is a protector it will be different if you just want a snuggle bug. But this is the most well rounded dog breeds to get. Starting off strong we have the Labrador Retriever. This family-friendly, smart, and fun-loving breed is a favorite in households across America. And to add on, they are absolutly beautiful dogs. Next up we have a expensive but adorable breed. The French Bulldog, sometimes they love to run and play, and sometimes they just want to lie around and be loved. They thrive on human contact and attention, which is great for some people I know. Next up is the big ol' German Sheperd. This breed is very adorable but is very protective. They are nick named and used as cop dogs. They are used as one because of there protectivness and there very high IQ. Next up we have the poodle. This is my personal favorite because I own one that is mixed with a labradoodle. They're smart, easy to train, eager to please, and lots of fun to be around. Making them a wonderful dog. Lastly, but defintly not least we have the Golden Retriver. They are very athletic and very cute. They are perfect if you have a little new born with you or good for a family dog. They are very goofy and loving.</p>
