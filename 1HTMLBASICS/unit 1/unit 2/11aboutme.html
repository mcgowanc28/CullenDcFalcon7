                <p style = "color:blue;font; font-size:20px""> Hello, welcome to the webpage about Cullen Mcgowan. I am a smart, outgoing, and funny person. I really enjoy most things with sports and hanging with other people. I go to a private school which is a third for my family. I got recrutied to play hockey here by my best friends who go here whom are the McNamaras. I was at a public school before this which was quite a experience. I live at home with my mom and dad who are great and push me to the absolute best. I also have two brothers who are 18 and 25. They are great aswell. I have a puppy named mario but have lost a legend named stanley. I have a lot of goals and can not wait to fill them. </p>

               <p style = "color:yellowgreen;font; font-size:20px"">To wrap it up, that is mostly all about me! In life one of my main goals and most important is my relashionship with God. That is one of the most important reasons I came to a private catholic school. I order my life as God, Family, School, then lastly hockey. I feel as if that is most important to order it as. My favorite sports team is the Detriot Red Wings. They are on a great come up to the playoffs. That is it hope you enjoyed!</p>
