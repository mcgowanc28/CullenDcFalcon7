              <p> Hello, welcome to the webpage about Cullen Mcgowan. I am a smart, outgoing, and funny person. I really enjoy most things with sports and hanging with other people. I go to a private school which is a third for my family. I got recrutied to play hockey here by my best friends who go here whom are the McNamaras. I was at a public school before this which was quite a experience. I live at home with my mom and dad who are great and push me to the absolute best. I also have two brothers who are 18 and 25. They are great aswell. I have a puppy named mario but have lost a legend named stanley. I have a lot of goals and can not wait to fill them. </p>
