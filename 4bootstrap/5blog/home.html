This blog is for die hard hockey fans, or people who wanna sheck hockey out for the first time! I reccomend this blog to you so you can keep up with the lastest action! Ice hockey, game between two teams, each usually having six players, who wear skates and compete on an ice rink. The object is to propel a vulcanized rubber disk, the puck, past a goal line and into a net guarded by a goaltender, or goalie. With its speed and its frequent physical contact, ice hockey has become one of the most popular of international sports. The game is an Olympic sport, and worldwide there are more than a million registered players performing regularly in leagues. It is perhaps Canadaâ€™s most popular game.</p>
