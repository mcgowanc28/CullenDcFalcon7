        <p> To start it off, dogs are one of the most loyal animals on the planet. I know we all know the saying, "a dog is a mans bestfriend". Good thing for us, that is so true! Besides being very loyal, dogs are very protective of there owners, they are your little ride or dies. Now obviously if you have a huge cane corso, he will protect you a little better than a shih tzu. But all dogs will be there for you right at your side. To continute on the personality of there beautiful souls, they can be very intelligent. If you train your dog to do certain things, they can be your little Albert Einstein buddy. Some people think the smartest thing they can do is climb ladders, or chase a ball. But hands down the smartest thing is to understand our language and gestures. To be real, they learn a new language in there 14 years of living and can go fetch you a pop if you want.  </p>
